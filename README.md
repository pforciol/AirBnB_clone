# AirBnB Clone

The goal of this project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

Our application will be composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
* A website that shows the final: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data

---

## The command interpreter
### Execution
The command interpreter can be launched in interactive or non-interactive mode as follows:
* Interactive Mode: `$ ./console.py`
* Non-interactive Mode: `$ echo <command> | ./console.py`

### Usage
